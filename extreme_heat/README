# Vulnerable Communities Platform
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Vulnerable Communities Platform, developed by the California Governor's Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation (LCI). In this GitHub repository, you will find the code, data sources, and methdology associated with our platform. 

## Structure
The repository is structured in the following way:

Each of the five hazards has a folder. Each folder contains code developed for indicators (when applicable), available in Python (.ipynb) and R (.Rmd), as well as a metadata file outlining the methdology and data sources used.
